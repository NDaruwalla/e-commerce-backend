<!-- image credit: this image is from icons8-->

## Objective
The objective of this e-commerce back end solution is to modify starter code and configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The goal is to understand the fundamental architecture of internet retail platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce which provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
